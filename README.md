# ⚽ Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Player Analytics

A complete end-to-end data analytics and machine learning project using Fantasy Premier League data to help optimize fantasy team selection, uncover player performance insights, and build predictive models.

---

## 📥 Data Acquisition & Cleaning

- ✅ **Scraping**: Data scraped from the official FPL website (7th October 2024) using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
- 🧹 **Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled nulls, standardized formats.
- 🏗️ **Feature Engineering**: Derived new features such as:
  - Points per 90 minutes
  - Attack/Defense efficiency scores
  - Form indicators

---

## 📊 Analysis & Reporting (Tableau / Power BI)

- 🧠 Created **team and player dashboards** showcasing:
  - Player rankings by position
  - Team-wise point distribution
  - Position-wise performance heatmaps
- 📌 Built for strategic fantasy decisions and comparisons

---

## 📈 EDA & Statistical Testing

- 📉 **Trend Analysis**:
  - Season-wise points, performance over time
  - Position & team-based trends
- 📊 **Correlation & Outlier Detection**
- 🧪 **Statistical Tests**:
  - ANOVA: To analyze variance across multiple positions
  - T-Test: To compare top-tier vs mid-tier players
  - Chi-square: For categorical dependencies
  - Mutual Information: For feature relevance

---

## 🧬 Feature Selection

- 🧪 **Filter Methods**: Correlation, Variance Threshold
- 🔁 **Wrapper Methods**: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
- 🧩 **Embedded Methods**: Feature importance from tree-based models

---

## 🤖 Modeling

- 🚀 **Baseline Models**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
- 💡 **Advanced Modeling (via PyCaret)**:
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Ensemble Models

---

## 🎯 Hyperparameter Tuning

- Applied **GridSearchCV** and **PyCaret’s AutoML** features for optimal parameters.
- Evaluated models using metrics like R², RMSE, MAE across training and validation sets.

---

## 🌐 Web Development & Hosting

- Built an interactive web app using **Streamlit** for:
  - Player selection predictions
  - Position-wise comparison
  - Model summary and insights
- [Optional: Add a deployment link if hosted]

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Automate weekly data scraping and model updates
- Add team formation recommender system

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates a **full data pipeline** — from scraping raw data to statistical analysis, ML modeling, and visualization. It combines both **technical expertise and domain knowledge** in football analytics to provide actionable insights.
