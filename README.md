# Fantasy Premier League - Best Player Predictor [try our web ☝🏻](https://huggingface.co/spaces/shimona02/FPLPredictor)

This is a **Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Best Player Predictor** web app built using **Streamlit**. The app allows users to filter and select FPL players based on various factors such as position, team, price range, and predicted performance.

## Features
- Select players based on position, team, and price range.
- Predict upcoming event points using a trained **PyCaret regression model**.
- Enforce FPL constraints (**2 Goalkeepers, 5 Defenders, 5 Midfielders, 3 Forwards**).
- Display selected players in a separate tab.
- Reset selections when needed.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bhumilad/FPL.git
or
Download manually
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment
```sh
python -m venv env
```

### 3. Activate Virtual Environment
#### Windows:
```sh
env\Scripts\activate
```
#### Mac/Linux:
```sh
source env/bin/activate
```


### 5. Download Model & Data
- Ensure that the trained **PyCaret model** (`modeling_withoutForm.ipynb`) is available in the project folder.
- Ensure that the **dataset** (`final_fpl_data.csv`) is also available in the project folder.

## How to Run
```sh
streamlit run fpl.py
```
